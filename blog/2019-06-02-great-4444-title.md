title: It's so nice to be together!
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long

And wouldn't it be nice to live together

In the kind of world where we belong



You know it’s gonna make it that much better

When we can say goodnight and stay together



Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up

In the morning when the day is new

And after having spent the day together

Hold each other close the whole night through



Ah, happy times together we'd be spending

I wish that every kiss was never ending

Oh, wouldn't it be nice



Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true

Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do

Oh, we could be married (oh, we could be married)

And then we’d be happy (and then we’d be happy)



Oh, wouldn't it be nice



You know it seems the more we talk about it

It only makes it worse to live without it

But, let’s talk about it

Oh, wouldn't it be nice



Goodnight, oh, baby

Sleep, my darlin’, baby

Goodnight, my baby

Sleep, my darling, baby

Goodnight, my baby

Sleep, my darlin’, baby
