title: Home Sweet Home
---
Inspired by real-world Thai mythology and beliefs, Home Sweet Home is the first in a series of terrifying narrative-driven first-person horror games.

Home Sweet Home throws players into a dark and twisted labyrinth, where a miasma of fear fills the air, dread bleeds through cracks in the ceiling and seeps down through broken floorboards, and anxiety grows stronger with every step.
